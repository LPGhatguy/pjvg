# Portable JSON Vector Graphics (PJVG)
This is a specification for a new image format called PJVG, intended to be a lean but full-featured vector image format. It is targeted at games and other platforms where lightweight, reproducable vector graphics are desirable.

There is no current stable version of the specification.

The current draft version is `p5a`, implemented as `0.0.0-p5a`.

The specification is available to browse [here](spec/index.md).
